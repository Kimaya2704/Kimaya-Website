          <h1 class="about-content">Hello!! My name is Kimaya Hajarnis. </h1>
          <p class="about-content">I am currently studying at College Of Engineering , Pune(COEP). This was my attempt at creating a website to polish my skills as well as show case my projects or written content. If I had to describe myself then the first word that pops into my head is an overthinker :p because that's how I've lived most of life. But I guess that's not all too bad as it keeps me prepared for every scenario. I was never a stranger to struggle but I can now say that I have enough strength to fight back. Anyway enough about me. I made this website to reflect on life, work and art. I hope you have a pleasurable experiance in exploring it. </p>
